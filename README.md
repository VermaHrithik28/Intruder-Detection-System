# Intruder Detection using Image Processing

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Intruder Detection system based on Image Processing techniques. The project aims to utilize Computer Vision (CV) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) concepts to detect intruders in a given environment using Python. OpenCV, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries have been employed to implement the solution.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective:** To develop an R&D project for intruder detection using CV and DIP concepts.
- **Tools:** Python, OpenCV, Pandas, Matplotlib.
- **Concepts Used:** Background Subtraction, Object Detection, Motion Analysis.
- **Features:**
  - Real-time intruder detection from video feed.
  - Motion analysis and tracking.
  - Reporting and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.
